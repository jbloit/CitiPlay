CitiPlay
=============

An interactive hopscotch game designed during the SF urban prototyping hackathon weekend. Sept. 28-30, 2012.

CitiPlay is a concept of turning a sidewalk into a game board. While this can take many shapes and forms, we did it by creating an interactive portable game of hopscotch.
